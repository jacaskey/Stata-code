# Stata-code
The .ado files are Stata programs, the .hlp files are Stata help files. Some of the programs require that you have other programs installed. If you encounter an "unrecognized program: <program name>" error in STATA, you can type "findit <program name>" to try to find the missing program on line. You can install any of the following programs individually by copying the relevant .ado and .hlp files to your ado directory (see here). You can find the directory by typing "personal" into the Stata command line.

See the UCLA Academic Technology Services' excellent statistical computing website http://www.ats.ucla.edu/stat/overview.htm for a variety of examples and references. Also see the programs on the Michigan Accounting PhD web site.
